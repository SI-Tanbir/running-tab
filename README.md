**Problem Statement:** I often find my browser cluttered with numerous unnecessary tabs, which hinders productivity and organization.

**Solution:** This extension provides a centralized dashboard to view all currently active browser tabs in a clear, manageable list.

**Key Features:**
*   **Complete Tab Overview:** Easily see a structured list of all open tabs across browser windows.
*   **Efficient Tab Management:** Quickly close unneeded tabs individually or in groups directly from the list.
*   **Copy Tab URLs:** Export a list of URLs for reference, sharing, or saving for later.

**Value Proposition:** This tool is designed to reduce digital clutter, improve browser performance, and mitigate the anxiety of potentially closing important tabs (FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out), promoting a more focused and organized workflow.
